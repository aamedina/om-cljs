# cljs

A Leiningen template for ClojureScript projects.

Comes with vanilla Bootstrap 3 LESS for CSS, a dev server with easy to use ClojureScript REPL support, and a "hello, world!" Om component to get you started!

## Usage

Fire up a REPL and when you're in your user namespace, type (go) to start the dev server on localhost:3000.

You can exit the CLJS REPL by typing :cljs/quit, and reset (and reload all Clojure namespaces as well, useful for easing macro development in ClojureScript) by calling (reset). Calling (reset) will also bring you back into a CLJS REPL.
